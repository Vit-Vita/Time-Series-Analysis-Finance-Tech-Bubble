# The Nvidia-Led Tech Bubble : Time Series Analysis

This project analyzes NVIDIA Corporation's recent stock market performance and its potential impact on the S&P 500, amid concerns of a new market bubble driven by artificial intelligence (AI) investments. In April 2024, the semiconductor sector's ratio to the S&P 500 exceeded dot-com bubble levels, with NVIDIA emerging as a key player, showcasing a 239% stock price growth in 2023. However, analysts warn that failure to meet earnings estimates could trigger a market crash, reminiscent of the 1990s tech bubble.

## Research Questions
1. Can NVIDIA's recent stock price surge and potential decline trigger a market crash?
2. What is the projected volatility for NVIDIA's future performance?

## Methodology
1. Descriptive Analysis: Visualized NVIDIA's stock trends and examined potential AI bubble risks.
2. Data Collection: Retrieved stock prices of NVIDIA, S&P 500, and other tech giants from Yahoo Finance.
3. Simulated Market Shock: Analyzed the impact of a sharp NVIDIA stock decline using Cisco's 2000-2002 crash data.
4. Statistical Modeling:
- VAR Models: Evaluated NVIDIAâ€™s influence on the S&P 500.
- GARCH Model: Predicted future volatility and assessed value at risk (VaR).

## Key Findings
- NVIDIA's stock significantly influences the S&P 500, but alone might not trigger a market crash.
- High volatility in NVIDIA's returns suggests potential bubble behavior.
- A sharp depreciation could increase investment risk, but a diversified portfolio may mitigate losses.
  
## Conclusion
While NVIDIA has a notable market impact, a broader negative investor sentiment would be necessary to precipitate a major market downturn. The GARCH model indicates continued high volatility, highlighting the uncertainty in NVIDIA's future performance.
